Primates are important herbivores in many ecosystems. They are not only influenced by the plants they eat but also influence the ecosystem through eating plants. I am interested in how the properties of food influence the digestion of primates. Meanwhile, I am also interested in the ecological impact of primates. Since I become a student at PRI, I have been focusing on the effects of diet composition, and dietary toughness on chewing and digestion in Japanese macaques. In my future studies, I plan to investigate how the feeding behavior of white-headed langurs influences the plant community in their habitat.
