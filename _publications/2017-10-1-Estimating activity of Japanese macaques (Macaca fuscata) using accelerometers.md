excerpt: 'Accelerometers have been used to study both terrestrial and aquatic wildlife, mainly for mammal and bird species. In terrestrial mammals, there is a bias toward ungulates and carnivores, with fewer studies on nonhuman primates. In this study, we tested the use of accelerometers for studying the activity of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We modeled the activity of a male and a female subject by matching continuous focal observations from video recordings to sensor parameters derived from collar-mounted accelerometers. Models achieved classification performance (AUC) of greater than 90% for both subjects, with similar results when subjects were cross-validated. Accelerometer-based estimates of activity had comparable accuracies to estimates from instantaneous sampling at 1 min and 5 min intervals. We further demonstrated the use of model estimates for analyzing circadian rhythm and night time activity of M. fuscata. Our results add support to the feasibility of using accelerometers for studying activity of nonhuman primates. We discussed the limitations, benefits and potential applications of remote-sensing technology like accelerometers for advancing primalotogical studies.

Such techniques have been increasingly used to collect biological information of a wide range of animals (Cooke et al., 2004; Nathan et al., 2012; Ropert-Coudert &amp; Wilson, 2005; Ropert-Coudert, Kato, Gr??????millet, &amp; Crenner, 2012). Different bio-logger sensors (or in combination) can be used to collect video or still images of animals, information on location (Global Positioning System [GPS]), acoustic telemetry, depth, environment (ambient temperature, light level, oxygen concentration, salinity, sound), and physiology (body temperature , heart rate, blood oxygen concentration) (Davis, 2008). Accelerometers have been specifically applied to assist biologists in measuring the movement and behavior of animals remotely. Such sensors measure gravitational and inertial acceleration caused by animal movements on different planes to estimate activity; and is a well-established tool in human biomechanics and sports science (Morris, 1973; Servais et al., 1984).
